    <h2>To my love (^o^)</h2>
    <p class="text">
      You're the best thing that life has given me so far and I know nothing can take your place in my heart. The love I have for you is pure and eternal! You bring so much joy into my life that it's hard for me to imagine a life without you.<br/><br/>
      Since I met you, it's like paradise. I love you not only for who you are, but for who I am with you. You've made me a better person and always believed in me. I think I fell in love with you even before I met you.<br/><br/>
      Life has challenges, but with you, I can take on anything. I love you for all that you are, all that you have been, and all you're yet to be. If I know what love is, it's because of you!<br/><br/>
      I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, BABEE! HAPPY GIRLFRIEND'S DAY!
